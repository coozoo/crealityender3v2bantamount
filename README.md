# Creality Ender3 v2 Banta Mount
Silent head upgrade for creality ender 3 V2 banta mount

This upgrade inspired by some mod that I've seen the only what original from this mod it's cooling air tubes (fangs).

Base redesigned to allow original hotend place (on the metal plate), mount crtouch with native mount hook, two airflow tubes(it can be used just with one but better two) and led strip holder with sesnsor button.

What you need for this mod:
- Noctua NF-A4x20 FLX - 3 pcs (or any other silent 40mm cooler with acceptable noise level)
- LM2596s DC-DC step-down power supply module - 2 pcs (again you can get any other converter to convert 24V to 12V)
- m3x1.2 screws - ~30 pcs
- m3 nuts - ~30 pcs

(you can reduce amount of screws and nuts by using longer screws m3*25 so it wwill be enough to screw whole fan through)

- enough dust mesh to cut 3 pcs 40x40mm
- cable ties

LED highlight
- Touch Sensor Dimmable Switch 5-24V, Hole 10mm
